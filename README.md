### Questions

1. Was the use of clamp appropriate -- is this the best way to use 
this feature ? (line 122) I was aiming to have the h2 get slightly bigger
as the screen grows. I believe this was achieved. Any feedback would be welcomed. 

2. When you have a flexbox -- and you set gap to a percentage -- 
what is this percentage based on ? Is it based on the width of the parent element ? 

3. I have used the picture element to change the different background
images. I have used Kevin Powell's YouTube Short as the inspiration 
for this: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d9i68C628Nk. 

However, I have left px as the default unit on this. Should 
it be changed to rem or em ?

## My process
I have broken down the styling: 

1. neutral properties (applies to all)
2. mobile properties
3. desktop properties
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
