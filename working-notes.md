We want to take some notes off of the guy on frontend mentor. 

Use these notes as basis point. 




 RE-DESIGN THE CORE LAYOUT. 

* Plan: 

As we have already re-designed the core layout using codepen, 
all we need to do is use these foundations as the core layout. 
First, re-name the existing html and css docs trash-1 and 
trash-2. Start again with two new documents. Then, use the 
trash docs to fill in content where appropriate. Make sure to 
use the appropriate class-names. 



* Check list: 

Go through: 

1. Get rid of the font-size root adjustment. 
2. Change all of the px to rem. 
3. Make sure that the line heigt is left unitless. 
4. Go through the fm-notes document + Setia's latest comment, making sure there are no errors. 
5. Test the html online before posting on fm-mentor.
