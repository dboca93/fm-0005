We want to take some notes off of the guy on frontend mentor. 

Use these notes as basis point. 

1. We need to come up with a plan to complete the background-images. 
One way, might involve using the picture notes on the kevin powell 
video. 

If this doesn't work we can try using the method on the fm guys page; 
who put the images on the background of the body html. 

Clearly, we have two label the pictures properly as the all look the same 
without being properly named.

2. RE-DESIGN THE CORE LAYOUT. 

Keep the core grid layout on both desktop and mobile. However, 
it may be better to use two side-by-side flex boxes in the 
upper part.
